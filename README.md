# 🎮 Tetris Game — Python (pygame)

A complete implementation of the classic **Tetris game** built using **Python and pygame**, developed from planning to final execution using a **Kanban workflow**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project recreates the core mechanics of Tetris, including falling blocks, grid-based movement, line clearing, scoring, and game-over detection.
The goal of this project was not only to build a working game, but also to practice **real-world software development workflows** such as task planning, version control, and iterative development.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **pygame**
* **Git & GitHub**
* **GitHub Projects (Kanban Board)**

---

## 🚀 Features

* Game window and main loop
* Grid-based board system
* All standard Tetris blocks (I, J, L, O, S, T, Z)
* Block rotation and movement
* Collision detection
* Line clearing logic
* Score tracking
* Game over condition
* Next block preview

---

## 📋 Development Workflow

* All features were planned using a **Kanban board**
* Each feature was broken into small, manageable tasks
* Git commits were linked to specific tasks using task IDs
* Tasks moved through **Backlog → Ready → In Progress → Review → Done**

This workflow mirrors how real-world software teams manage projects.
